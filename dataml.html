		<h1>What is data?</h1>
		<p>Reflect for a minute on the tasks you perform in a single day--from the moment you wake up, 
		to the time you fall asleep. If you were to list everything you did in this day, and included things like time, 
		transactions, weather conditions, thoughts, where you went, what you ate...you would have a collection of raw 
		facts about what you did in that one day. <strong>And that's exactly what data is!</strong></p>

			</div>
        <h2>
            Data is created when raw facts, either as observational abstractions or measurements, 
    about the world are recorded.</h2>

		<p>Once these individual data points are collected and categorized (e.g. today‚Äôs hourly temperatures in Brooklyn, NY, USA), this data 
		is now called information.</p>

			</div>
		<p>Information is valuable because past events may assist in the prediction of future events. For example, 
		say you had a collection of all the hourly temperatures in Brooklyn, NY taken over a period of ten years. 
		Assuming you are not using a weather app, if you wanted to find out what today‚Äôs high temperature for Brooklyn, 
		NY would be, you can predict this temperature by taking the average of all those hourly temperature readings for 
		today‚Äôs date over the past ten years. It may sound like a data analysis, but that's exactly what machine learning is!</p>

	<div id="datanalysis"><!--DATA ANALYSIS AND MACHINE LEARNING-->
		<h1><a href="index.html">Machine Learning</a> is a method of data analysis</h1>
		<p>Machine learning is one of the many methods of data analysis which uses a specific set of 
		techniques or algorithms to make statistical generalizations about data (like the weather!) without explicit human intervention
		<a href="references.html"> (McSweeney).</a> This comes in handy when working with large datasets (aka<strong> BIG DATA</strong>), because these "algorithms give computers the ability to 
		learn from data and then make predictions and decisions" <a href="references.html">(Crash Course)</a> very quickly.</p>
