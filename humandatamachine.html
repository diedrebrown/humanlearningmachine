            <p>As we have discussed throughout this site, machine learning has profoundly affected all arenas of human life. 
            However, it is important to remember that we as humans also play a role in the development of machine learning. 
            Humans are responsible for:</p>

                </table>

            <p>And without human oversight and engagement, the path of development of machine learning and the overarching goals of artificial intelligence will always remain elusive. </p>

            <p>While data and machine learning algorithms on their own are not bias, we as human beings are. Through life experience, and developing a preference or an inclination towards or 
            against something, bias develops in every human being. Though sometimes bias can be unreasoned, that is not to say that it permanent. 
            As writer Adam Gopnik stated in <i>The New Yorker,</i> ‚ÄúPerhaps our intelligence is not just ended by our mortality; to a degree, it is our mortality.‚Äù 
            And we would further argue that it our duty to ensure that our individual uniqueness is always accounted for in the use of algorithms, analysis of data, and the development of artificial intelligence. </p>
