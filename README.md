# humanlearningmachine
<strong><em>[human learning machine]</em></strong> is an informational website that aims to demystify the topic of machine learning for anyone--novice to professional--curious about the subject and its wider implications on human life, and in the larger field of artificial intelligence.

<h2>Topic Overview</h2>
<p>As a group consisting of Information Experience Design and Data Analysis and Visualization students at the School of Information at Pratt Institute, we share an interest in the applications of information technology,specifically machine learning, which is one of today’s most rapidly growing technical fields. Our website aims to demystify the topic of machine learning for anyone--novice to professional--curious about the subject and its wider implications on human life, and in the larger field of artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>To illustrate the subject in a general but informed manner, we divided the site into three subject related sections and one about page. Luckily, as our group consisted of three members, we each were able to provide content a one section based on our personal interests. Briefly, these main sections included:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ML 101</strong> - our homepage and an introduction to and the history of machine learning by Michael Lewis.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A simple history of machine learning.</li>
    <li>Timeline in a vertical linear content to make it amenable to web reading on all devices.</li>
    <li>Different types of machine learning.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>HAPPENING</strong> - a review of current trends and applications in machine learning by Jihye Woo.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Overview of machine learning applications in the real-world.</li>
    <li>Machine learning in Finance.</li>
    <li>Machine learning in Healthcare.</li>
    <li>Machine learning in Art.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>DATA ML</strong> - a perspective of machine learning as a method of data analysis by Diedre Brown.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>What is data and how is machine learning a method of data analysis?</li>
    <li>The Process of Machine Learning. Understanding some machine learning technology and applying it to an embedded snippet of R code.</li>
    <li>The Human Data Machine. What roles do humans play in machine learning?</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Eager to practice and improve our coding skills, we elected to hand code the website in HTML and CSS over using a CMS platform like Wordpress. Once we designed a prototype in Adobe XD (XD), hand coding also enabled us to craft a distinctive aesthetic, which we felt matched our subject matter.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>We feel one of the most beneficial aspects of the project was learning from each other. As we
each came to this project with a desire to improve our coding skills, hand-coding enabled us to pool and
share our knowledge as we continually asked the question, “How do we do that?”. Additionally, this
knowledge share is what led to our crafting of a design prototype in XD. The prototype gave each team
member a clear style guideline, layout, and concept of what the site should look like once coded in HTML
and CSS, which was an extremely helpful reference to prepare work on our own for group meetings.
Also, quick iterations from the XD prototype made tackling layout issues less of a challenge because the
program provides quantitative measures for things like margins, padding, font type, style, and size. And, as with all scholarly endeavors, for every challenge the project presented, we gained new insights. Two particular challenges included:
<ul>
  <li><p>Working collaboratively to hand code the website. It was pretty hard to work collaboratively
because we each had files over three different machines. Because something as simple as a little
bit of miscode could ruin the whole website, we doubled our efforts to make sure everything was
formatted, and we synchronized our CSS code so that no miscellaneous or redundant code would
interfere with a page’s layout or function. Having now gone through the process of developing a
website as part of a team, we think we could have benefited from using a version control system,
like GitHub. However, to use GitHub most efficiently would have also required learning Git, which (at the time of creation) we did not feel we had enough time to do.</p></li>
  <li><p>Editing content for the web and time. Though we each had a loose understanding of machine
learning, as our subject is particularly dense, a significant amount of time had to be spent both
researching and editing our content for a general audience.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we had more time to work on the project, we would like to create a sub-menu under the upper-menu of the navigation bar, explore using Javascript elements throughout, and write our own Shiny web interpreter application for the R code we used.</p>
