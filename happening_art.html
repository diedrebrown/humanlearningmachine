        <p style="padding-top: 35px;">Art is considered as creative areas where human-only creates with artists' purpose and feelings. However, machine learning has started to influence these creative areas today. How is this possible? It seems quite an interesting trend nowadays, right? Let's take a look at some ways people have started to pair these technologies with art.
            
             <h2 style="padding-top: 60px">The first piece of art created by a machine learning to come to auction</h2>
            <p>
            Last October, the New York auction house Christie’s sold Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, an algorithm-generated print in the style of 19th-century European portraiture, for $432,500. It was nearly 45 times its high estimate — as Christie’s becomes the first auction house to offer a work of art created by an algorithm.</p>
            <p>
            The art work features a fictional person named Edmond de Belamy, described by Christie's as a "portly gentleman, possibly French and — to judge by his dark frockcoat and plain white collar — a man of the church." The signature on the painting is the actual algorithm used to create it. Obvious co-founder Hugo Caselles-Dupré said the AI was fed a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries. The AI features a "Generator" which makes a new image, and a "Discriminator" which attempts to tell which images were made by man or the algorithm.</p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 60px">Artechouse - MACHINE HALLUCINATION</h2>
        
        <p>It's full swing now in NYC! Machine Hallucination, Anadol’s first large-scale installation in New York City is a mixed reality experiment deploying machine learning algorithms on a dataset of over 300 million images—representing a wide-ranging selection of architectural styles and movements—to reveal the hidden connections between these moments in architectural history. As the machine generates a data universe of architectural hallucinations in 1025 dimensions, we can begin to intuitively understand the ways that memory can be spatially experienced and the power of machine intelligence to both simultaneously access and augment our human senses. By embedding photography with machine intelligence a new latent cinematic experience is born, one that narrates the fluid consciousness of a city and displays cultural information in a way that allows us to realize the complex fabric that unfolds our present realities.</p>
