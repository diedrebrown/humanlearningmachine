			<h1>ABOUT THIS SITE:</h1>
			<p>Nearly all aspects of modern life are in some way being changed by big data and machine learning <a href="references.html">(Beam & Kohane, 2018)</a>. As a group consisting of Information Experience Design and Data Analysis and Visualization students, we share an interest in the applications of information technology, specifically machine learning, which is one of today‚Äôs most rapidly growing technical fields. Our website aims to demystify the topic of machine learning for anyone--novice to professional--curious about the subject and its wider implications on human life, and in the larger field of artificial intelligence.</p>
			<p><a href="references.html">Check out our references.</a></p>

					<p>A design strategist and UX designer living in New York City. Let‚Äôs start with few of my bad habits:</p>
                        <p>1. Considerably curious and observant most of the time</p>
                        <p>2. Can't resist to pet adorable dogs around the neighborhood</p>
                        <p>3. Spent approximately 80,000 minutes per year listening to disco, deep house, and indie music. (Spotify‚Äôs recommendation algorithm happened to be the reason why I‚Äôm interested with machine learning)</p>  
					<p>Also, I am regularly empathizing with BEAUTIFUL HUMANS at day, amateur cook during the night. If you are here reading my profile, "Hello, beautiful humans!‚Äù</p>
